# Cleaning, exploring and modelling housing data with multiple linear regression
As part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, I got a primer on machine learning basics and the opportunity to put them to the test. This is one of my first forrays into these dark arts!
In this project, I identify basic trends in the data and apply appropriate modelling, transformation and validation techniques to produce a 72% accurate predictive model.

# About the data
This dataset was provided by IBM, and comes from King County USA, including Seattle, between May 2014 and May 2015. You'll find descriptions of each variable in the dataset within the notebook.
